# Production AI Research & Knowledge Agent

A production-oriented AI research and engineering knowledge agent for a curated corpus of AI, LLM, RAG, and Agentic AI technical documents.

## Objective

The system is designed to answer increasingly complex technical questions using:

- Advanced retrieval
- Agentic research workflows
- Self-hosted LLM inference
- Evidence verification
- Citations
- Memory
- Evaluation
- Observability

The system will be developed incrementally, starting with a baseline RAG implementation and introducing advanced techniques only when they provide measurable value.

## Target Corpus

The initial corpus will contain approximately 100–300 high-quality technical documents covering:

- RAG and retrieval
- Embeddings and vector search
- HNSW and indexing
- LLM serving and inference
- KV caching and batching
- Quantization
- Agentic AI
- Memory
- RAG and LLM evaluation
- Hallucination and faithfulness
